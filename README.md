## Password Generator 

# Description 
In this project I was tasked with making a functional random password generator based on user inputs using JavaScript. 
The User should be prompted to select a paaword length.
THEN through a series of prompts decide whether to use lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special charaters.
THEN a randomly generated passowrd will generate in the designated spot on the page.
IF an incorrect length is selected or all prompted are declined, USER will be prompted to try again and instructed why the app failed.

# Usage 
Click the "Generate Password" button and work through the prompts. After you will be presented with your random password.
